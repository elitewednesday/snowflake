                        It's funny how I got the chance to know such a smart, messed up, naughty, funny asf, cute, short, brilliant, and talented girl like you. 🥰 O, I thank thee for bringing such a blissful sunshine into my life (and a big ass storm too 🌩️). I can't ask for more than that, love.

                        I pray that Yahweh will grace you with His presence and restore anything you may have lost over the years. That He shall continue to bless you with a heart as pure as lost treasure 🪙 which was found by a dirty soul like mine. Jane, you'll always be one of my most cherished friends in this lifetime and shall forever be not just a well-wisher, nor a close pal, but an angel sent down from the Most High to shine down on my... nasty azz personality. 😈✨

                        Have the most joyous birthday, dearie. 🎉🎂 And may your family and loved ones know no misfortune. This and many more I pray for... my dear Miroku-chan 🫂🥹. I'll never EVER stop worrying you, nor would I ever stop loving you. 🤧❤️🔥

                        I thank you for always being there for me, even when I act all rude and shhhi 🫠💔. I shall forever reciprocate the kindness, brotherly love, and peace you've shown me. 🥹 Happy birthday, baby girl! 🐦🔥🔥🔥

                        You've always been a great friend and I'll forever cherish the times that we spent together in school (even the times when we were ghosting each other for no good reason). The nights we'd spend talking in front of your dorm till midnight, gossiping about the people in the Home group😂😂👍 good times.
                        Happy birthday Ngoziii. Even though you're still just a kid🥱. I hope you have a good one.
